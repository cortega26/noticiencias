## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1.  **Baby Steps First:** Prioritize safe, small changes and incremental improvements over large refactors.
2.  **No Regressions:** Avoid introducing regressions at all costs. Verify every small step.
3.  **Diff Required:** First response MUST include diffs.
4.  **No Binary Files:** Do not commit binary files.
5.  **Output Safety:** Truncate large outputs.

## 🔁 WORKFLOW

1.  **DIFF:** Apply minimal, scoped changes.
2.  **TEST:** Verify immediately.
3.  **COMMIT:** Use conventional commits.
